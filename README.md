# IoT-Based Keypad Door Lock System

## Overview
This project simulates an IoT-based keypad door lock system using **Arduino Uno**, **C++**, and **Tinkercad**. The system allows users to input a password using a 4x4 keypad and unlock a door by controlling a servo motor. The system provides feedback via an **LCD Display** and **Piezo Buzzer**, and implements security features such as temporary and permanent lockouts after multiple failed attempts.

## Features
- **Password Input**: Users can input a password using a 4x4 keypad.
- **Servo Motor Control**: Unlocks the door by controlling the servo motor.
- **LCD Display**: Displays the current status and instructions.
- **Piezo Buzzer**: Provides real-time feedback for correct/incorrect attempts.
- **Security Lockout**: Temporarily or permanently locks the system after multiple failed attempts.
- **Backspace Function**: Allows users to correct their password input.

## Technologies
- **Arduino Uno**
- **C++ Programming**
- **Tinkercad** (Simulation)
- **4x4 Keypad**
- **Servo Motor**
- **LCD Display**
- **Piezo Buzzer**

## Components Required
1. Arduino Uno
2. 4x4 Keypad
3. Servo Motor
4. LCD Display (16x2)
5. Piezo Buzzer
6. Jumper Wires
7. Breadboard

## How to Use
1. Connect the hardware components as shown in the circuit diagram (available in the project repository).
2. Upload the code to your Arduino using the Arduino IDE.
3. Use the keypad to enter a password.
4. If the password is correct, the servo motor will unlock the door.
5. If the password is incorrect, a buzzer will sound, and after a set number of incorrect attempts, the system will lock temporarily or permanently.
